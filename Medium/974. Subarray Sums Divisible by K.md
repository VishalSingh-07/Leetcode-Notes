Medium


Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of non-empty **subarrays** that have a sum divisible by_ `k`.

A **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5], k = 9
Output: 0
```
**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
-   `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
-   `2 <= k <= 104`

#### Approach 1: Brute Force Approach

#### Complexity

-   Time complexity: O(n^2)
    
-   Space complexity: O(1)
    

**Steps--**

-   It initializes a variable count to zero to count the number of subarrays whose sum is divisible by k.
    
-   It loops through each element i of nums from the start to end of the array.
    
-   For each i, it initializes a variable sum to zero.
    
-   It loops through the remaining elements of nums from i to the end of the array.
    
-   For each element j, it adds nums[j] to sum.
    
-   If sum is divisible by k, it increments count.
    
-   The function returns the final value of count, which represents the number of subarrays in nums whose sum is divisible by k.
    

#### Code

```cpp
// Brute Force Approach
// Time complexity --> O(n^2) and Space -> O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n=nums.size();
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            int sum=0;
            for(int j=i;j<n;j++)
            {
                sum+=nums[j];
                if(sum%k==0)
                {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

Above code ❌ give Time limit Exceeded because of High time complexity O(n^2)

#### Approach 2: Optimized Approach

#### Complexity

-   Time complexity: O(n)
    
-   Space complexity: O(n)
    

**Steps--**

-   It initializes an unordered map rem_freq to keep track of the frequency of remainders obtained from the running sum.
    
-   It initializes two variables running_sum and count to zero to keep track of the running sum and the count of subarrays whose sum is divisible by k.
    
-   It sets the frequency of remainder 0 to 1 in the map rem_freq as initially the running sum is zero and thus is divisible by k.
    
-   It loops through each element i of nums from the start to end of the array.
    
-   For each i, it adds nums[i] to running_sum to update the running sum.
    
-   It calculates the remainder rem obtained from the running sum by performing running_sum%k.
    
-   If rem is negative, it adds k to it to make it positive as -2 % 5 = -2, but we want it to be 3.
    
-   If the frequency of remainder rem is not zero in rem_freq, it means that there is at least one previous subarray whose sum is divisible by k and ends at an index before the current index.
    
-   In that case, we add the frequency of rem in rem_freq to count.  
    We update the frequency of remainder rem in rem_freq by incrementing it by 1.
    
-   After the loop, we return the final value of count, which represents the number of subarrays in nums whose sum is divisible by k.
    

#### Code

```cpp
// Optimized Approach
// Time complexity --> O(n) and Space -> O(n)
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int,int> rem_freq;
        int running_sum=0,count=0;
        rem_freq[0]=1; //initially sum will be zero so it will be divisible by k(thats obvious);
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
        {
            running_sum+=nums[i];
            int rem=running_sum%k;
            if(rem<0)
            {
                rem+=k;
            }
            if(rem_freq[rem]!=0)
            {
                count+=rem_freq[rem];
            }
            rem_freq[rem]++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
