**[Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)**

Medium

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```


**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
-   `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
-   `0 <= k <= 105`

**Follow up:**

-   Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least  **three** different ways to solve this problem.
-   Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?


**Hint**
- The easiest solution would use additional memory and that is perfectly fine.
- The actual trick comes when trying to solve this problem without using any additional memory. This means you need to use the original array somehow to move the elements around. Now, we can place each element in its original location and shift all the elements around it to adjust as that would be too costly and most likely will time out on larger input arrays.
- One line of thought is based on reversing the array (or parts of it) to obtain the desired result. Think about how reversal might potentially help us out by using an example.
- The other line of thought is a tad bit complicated but essentially it builds on the idea of placing each element in its original position while keeping track of the element originally in that position. Basically, at every step, we place an element in its rightful position and keep track of the element already there or the one being overwritten in an additional variable. We can't do this in one linear pass and the idea here is based on **cyclic-dependencies** between elements.

#### Approach 1: Brute Force Approach


#### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(n)

  
#### Code

```c++

// Brute Force Approach

// Time complexity -> O(n) and Space -> O(n)

class Solution {

public:

    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {

        int n=nums.size();

        if(k>=n)

        {

            k = k%n;

        }

        vector<int>arr(n,0);

        int count=0;

        for(int i=n-k;i<n;i++)

        {

            arr[count++]=nums[i];

        }

        for(int i=0;i<n-k;i++)

        {

            arr[count++]=nums[i];

        }

        // copy arr vector into nums vector

        nums=arr;

    }

};

  

```

  

### OR

```c++

class Solution {

public:

    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {

        int n=nums.size();

        if(k>=n)

        {

            k = k%n;

        }

        vector<int>arr(n,0);

        int i,j=0;

        for(i=0;i<k;i++)

        {

            arr[i]=nums[n-k+i];

        }

        while(j<n-k)

        {

            arr[i++]=nums[j++];

  

        }

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)

        {

            nums[i]=arr[i];

        }

    }

};

```

  

#### Approach 2: Better Approach

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(n)

  

The steps involved in the rotate function are as follows:  

- The variable n is declared and initialized to the size of the input vector nums. This stores the length of the vector.

- A new vector temp is created with the same size as the input vector nums. This temporary vector will be used to store the rotated elements of the input vector.

- A for loop is used to iterate through each element of the input vector nums.

- Inside the loop, the value of nums[i] is assigned to temp[(i+k)%n]. This calculates the new index for each element after rotating by k positions. The modulo operator % is used to handle cases where the new index exceeds the length of the vector.

- After the for loop completes, the input vector nums is assigned the values of the temporary vector temp. This updates the original vector with the rotated elements.
  
#### Code

```c++

// Better Approach

// Time complexity -> O(n) and Space -> O(n)

class Solution {

public:

    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {

        int n=nums.size();

        vector<int> temp(n);

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)

        {

            temp[(i+k)%n]=nums[i];

        }

        nums=temp;

    }

};  

  

```

#### Approach 3: Optimized Approach

  

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(1)

  

The steps involved in the rotate function are as follows:

1. First, it reverses the elements from the start of the vector till n-k-1 index.

2. Then, it reverses the elements from n-k index till the end of the vector.

3. Finally, it reverses the entire vector, effectively rotating it by "k" elements to the right.

  

**Note:**

  

The line of code "k=k%n" takes the modulo of "k" with the size of the vector "n" to handle the case where "k" is greater than the size of the vector.

  

**For example**, suppose the size of the vector is "n=5" and "k=7". In this case, simply rotating the vector by "k" elements to the right would result in the same vector as rotating it by "k % n" = "7 % 5" = "2" elements to the right.

So, by taking the modulo of "k" with "n", we ensure that "k" is always less than "n", which makes sure that we only rotate the vector by the required number of elements to the right. This helps in avoiding unnecessary iterations and improves the efficiency of the code.

  

#### Code

```c++

// Optimized Approach

// Time complexity -> O(n) and Space -> O(1)

class Solution {

public:

    void reverse(vector<int>&nums, int low, int high)

    {

        while(low<high)

        {

            swap(nums[low],nums[high]);

            low++;

            high--;

        }

    }

    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {

        int n=nums.size();

        k=k%n;

        reverse(nums,0,n-k-1);

        reverse(nums,n-k,n-1);

        reverse(nums,0,n-1);

    }

};

  

```
